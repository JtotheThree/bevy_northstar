# bevy_northstar
## A 2d/3d hierarchical pathfinding crate for Bevy. 

`bevy_northstar` works by dividing the map into chunks and then calculates nodes based on the entrances between chunks. The nodes are used in pathfinding to get a higher level path that is significantly faster to calculate over long distances. Once the high level path is determined between a start and goal point it's refined to get a more accurate path.

### This crate is still a work in progress.

The crate is currently opinionated in the sense that it's not bring-your-own-grid. That may change in the future.

## Features  
âœ… **Supports 2D and 3D Tilemaps** â€“ Works seamlessly with both 2D and 3D grids.  
âœ… **Optimized Performance** â€“ Algorithms are heavily benchmarked for efficiency.  
âœ… **Gizmo Debug View** â€“ Built-in visualization using Bevy's gizmo system.  
âœ… **2D Demo Included** â€“ Working example with profiling stats and collision.  
âœ… **Dynamic Collision & Avoidance** â€“ Uses a hashmap to efficiently update moving obstacles.  
âœ… **Bevy Systems Integration** â€“ Bevy systems and components for pathfinding.

## Roadmap / TODO  
ðŸš€ **Next Steps:**  
- [ ] **Code & Documentation Cleanup** â€“ Refine and document the API.  
- [ ] **Initial Crate Release** â€“ Publish the first version.  

ðŸ”§ **Planned Features & Improvements:**  
- [ ] **Modify & Rebuild Tiles Dynamically** â€“ Support updates to the tilemap after itâ€™s been built.  
- [ ] **Async Pathfinding Support** â€“ Enable async functions for avoidance cases where full path recalculations are needed for frame stability.  
- [ ] **Hierarchical Pathfinding** â€“ Implement multiple hierarchical levels for improved efficiency.  
- [ ] **Optimize 3D Performance** â€“ 3d grids appear to take a performance hit higher than expected currently.  
- [ ] **Pseudo-3D Tilemap Support** â€“ Add support for features like stairs and ramps without full 3D calculations.  
- [ ] **Parallelized Graph Building** â€“ Speed up grid/graph construction using parallelism.  
- [ ] **Parallel Bevy Systems** â€“ Optimize pathfinding system execution where possible.  
- [ ] **3D Examples & Demos** â€“ Provide additional examples for 3D use cases.
