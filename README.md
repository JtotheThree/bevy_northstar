AStar pathfinding crate for Bevy based on Godot's AStar pathfinding. Why? To make it easier to handle large 3d grids.

Currently replicating Godot's point hashmap based point storage in the most simplistic way to avoid borrow checking headaches. The current implementation isn't optimized and is in proof of concept phase.
