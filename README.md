# bevy_northstar
## A 2d/3d hierarchical pathfinding crate for Bevy. 

`bevy_northstar` works by dividing the map into chunks and then calculates nodes based on the entrances between chunks. The nodes are used in pathfinding to get a higher level path that is significantly faster to calculate over long distances. Once the high level path is determined between a start and goal point it's refined to get a more accurate path.

### This crate is still a work in progress.

The crate is currently opinionated in the sense that it's not bring-your-own-grid. That may change in the future.

## Demo

## Features  
âœ… **Supports 2D and 3D Tilemaps** â€“ Supports 2d and 3d tilemaps.  

âœ… **Optimized Performance** â€“ Algorithms are heavily benchmarked for efficiency.  

âœ… **Gizmo Debug View** â€“ Debug visuals for verifying the built HPA graph. Pathing debug components to visualize an entities path.  

âœ… **Stress Tests** â€“ 128x128 map with 128 entities to stress test HPA vs A* and collision. A collision example is provided to stress test narrow pathing.

âœ… **Dynamic Collision & Avoidance** â€“ For moving colliders attaching a simple Blocking marker component is all that's needed. If you use the built in systems the pathing will do a configurable look ahead to see if it can do a fast local A* reroute.

âœ… **Bevy Systems Integration** â€“ Bevy systems and components for pathfinding as well as collision markers when avoidance paths fail.

## Roadmap / TODO  
ðŸš€ **Next Steps:**  
- [ ] **Code & Documentation Cleanup** â€“ Refine and document the API.
- [ ] **Basic Example** - Create a minimal example demonstrating only the basics usage for the crate. Move existing examples to stress tests.
- [ ] **Release Beta Version** - Publish a beta version once the API is in a good place.

ðŸ”§ **Planned Features & Improvements:**  
- [ ] **Modify & Rebuild Grid Chunks Dynamically** â€“ Support updates to the grid after itâ€™s been built.    
- [ ] **Pseudo-3D Tilemap Support** â€“ Add support for features like stairs and ramps without full 3D calculations.  
- [ ] **Parallelized Graph Building** â€“ Speed up grid/graph construction using parallelism.  
- [ ] **Add Support For Multiple HPA Levels** â€“ Implement multiple hierarchical levels for improved efficiency.  
- [ ] **Optimize 3D Performance** â€“ 3d grids appear to take a performance hit higher than expected currently.
