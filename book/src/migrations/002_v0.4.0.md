# Migrating From v0.3.X to v0.4.X

## Grid::pathfinding, Grid::pathfinding_astar, Grid::pathfinding_coarse

`Grid::pathfinding` now handles all algorithms and only takes a single argument: `PathfindArgs`.
`PathfindArgs` is a builder to reduce the number of arguments required to pass to the pathfinding method.

You will need to update any manual pathfinding calls to use `PathfindArgs`

```rust,no_run
let grid = grid.into_inner();
let (player, grid_pos, move_action) = player.into_inner();

// Request a start (grid_pos.0) to goal (move_action.0) using the AStar algorithm.
let path = grid.pathfind(
    PathfindArgs::new(grid_pos.0, move_action.0).astar()
);
```
